<h1>UDAYAN  SHALINI  FELLOWSHIP PROGRAMME</h>
<P>
       Aurangabad falls in the Marathwada area of Maharashtra, slotted as a backward region under the Constitution of India.Women have not been encouraged to pursue education,especially at the higher level. Initiated by a team of dedicated women,wanting to make a difference,USF Aurangabad started with 13 Shalinis in 2008.Amazed at the complete transformation of the girls in a short span,40 young girls were inducted the very next year! The Fellowship enhanced mental stimulation; feelings of inferiority gave way to a sense of positivity infusing girls with a never before enthusiasm to learn .Shedding their shyness,they keenly participated in their school and college activities.Many came out as winners - whether it was for poster making or personality contests! Every Shalini here has made it her mission to give back to society. Their incredible social campaigns have not only enhanced their exposure but helped people in the vicinity too! Ranging from anti plastic to building rudimentary bridges in rural areas,they have benefited their communities immensely. Most of the Shalinis are completing graduation and on the threshold of making career choices. Hence workshops have helped development of skills and opened a range of options with many choosing specialised subjects like Computer Applications. The teaching profession still remains on top, as the girls feel its a "good way to help girls like us." For the small team and core committee here, it has only reiterated the belief that "each girl has the potential to blossom into a miracle of hope. We need to give her every opportunity to do so."</P>

<h4>OUR GOAL</h4>

<h4>NEED</h4>
<P>A mother's deep desire to educate her young daughter and build her a future,but her complete helplessness due to poverty, sparked the beginning of the UdayanShaliniProgramme.</P>

<div class="course-col">
<h4>IMPACT</h4>
<P>In addition to academic excellence, Shalinis have evolved as educated, responsible citizens, able to voice their opinions and take independent decisions. Many of them are becoming role models for their communities and our miracles of hope!</P>
