   	<h3>Shivani's Story</h3>
   	<p>With hope, strength is multiplied. After you have found the reason for your existence, you become a motivation to others. Shivani, from the slum area of Mandavali in east Delhi, had seen poverty and a lack of resources since her childhood. Her father struggled hard to sustain the family of six with his paltry income received from his blue-collar job of a peon in a private company.</p><br>
    <p>Despite the hardships, Shivani was single-mindedly focussed on achieving her financial independence and realizing her dream of living a dignified life. She completed her schooling from a government school and B.Com from Delhi University through distance learning. Later on, she enrolled at an Udayan Care Computer Learning Center, to complete her training in Tally ERP 9 which empowered her to secure a job with Thomas Cook, a renowned travel company. She is earning a salary of 13000 per month and assisting her family with pride.</p>

   	<h3>Shruti Kumari's Story</h3>
   	<p>"Household chores are the only job of girls and kitchen is their only performance arena." goes a famous saying in Shruti's village. Two years back no one in Tilapta village of western U. P. would have predicted that this shy 15-year girl could ever be a sports champion. 'My life changed for all good after I joined UdayanShalini Fellowship', recounts an emotional Shruti, who has personally gone through the pain of poverty, and wish to help the needy in her society.</p><br>

    <p>Owning a keen interest in wrestling, she derives her inspiration from the local world wrestling champion BabitaPhogat. She is an active participant of sports like volleyball and wrestling. She earned a silver medal in college-level wrestling. She is equally good at academics and scored first division marks in her grade 10 and 12. She dreams of becoming a physical trainer and supports needy children in multiple ways. Or should we say she has already started supporting by giving voluntary sports coaching to needy children of her society?</p>

   	<h3>Swati Keshri's Story</h3>
   	<p>The odds were against Swati from a young age. Growing up in a small family in Delhi, where her father was the sole earner, Swati and her family struggled to make ends meet. Despite her intelligence and conscientious nature, there were limited resources available for her primary education.

Although her parents did not receive a proper education, they did their best to support her in any way possible, but further education was a luxury they couldn’t afford.

The family’s financial situation worsened further when Swati’s mother was diagnosed with an intestinal ulcer. However, it was around this time that Swati heard about the UdayanShalini Fellowship Programme. Swati worked very hard and in 2009 was inducted on to the programme. “It was a proud moment for my parents and me when I was awarded the fellowship at the induction ceremony”.</p><br>
<p>Now, Swati is pursuing a PhD in Medical Genetics from the University of Cambridge and aspires to become a researcher and find a cure for neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s.</p>
